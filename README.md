# hello_world
First tutorial repository and testing grounds

Hi, I'm Brandon Barricklow. I'm here to learn programming concepts and languages to try and get a job. I really enjoy the process and challenge of coding, so I'm hoping   I can make a career out of it.
I'm going to try to learn to use Github and other necessary tools as I learn and improve my programming skills and I plan to try and track my growth here.
